## Installation

To start your application with MEAN, you need to clone the base MEAN repository from Github. This repository contains all the packages, modules and also a sample code base in order to start and make it easy to develop your application. Following the steps below will guide you to install the latest MEAN version.

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Hackbit/nko2017-news.git
cd nko2017-news
npm install  
npm start  
```
If all the packages and modules installed successfully, your default web browser will open and you can see the default MEAN application at `http://localhost:3000`. This is the default port unless you change that manually.
